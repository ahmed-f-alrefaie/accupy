### Sums

Summing up values in a list can get tricky if the values are floating point
numbers; digit cancellation can occur and the result may come out wrong. A
classical example is the sum
```
1.0e16 + 1.0 - 1.0e16
```
The actual result is `1.0`, but in double precision, this will result in `0.0`.
While in this example the failure is quite obvious, it can get a lot more
tricky than that. accupy provides
```python
p, exact = accupy.generate_ill_conditioned_sum(100, 1.0e20)
```
which given a length and a target condition number will produce an array if
floating point numbers that's hard to sum up.

accupy has the following methods for summation:

  * `accupy.kahan_sum(p)`: [Kahan
    summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm)

  * `accupy.fsum(p)`: A thin wrapper around
    [math.fsum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.fsum) (which
    uses the [Shewchuck
    algorithm](https://code.activestate.com/recipes/393090/))

  * `accupy.ksum(p, K=2)`: Summation in K-fold precision (from [[1]](#references))

Let's compare the methods.
