    The underlying problem is that the exact sum a+b of two floating point
    number a and b is not necessarily a floating point number; for example if
    you add a very large and a very small number. It is however known that the
    difference between the best floating point approximation of a+b and the
    exact a+b is again a floating point number. This routine returns the sum
    and the error.
